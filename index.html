        <h2> Tackling group Projects at UWI </h2>

            When I first came to UWI, I anticipated group projects for at least one course 
            each semester. But alas, I found myself working in group projects for a majority of my 
            courses ranging from computer science courses, to my foundational courses, to my 
            biology electives. There was no escape to the inevitable of working with other 
            people. I found myself having conflicts with others due to the fact our work technique 
            was vastly different or our schedules always clashed when it was time to meet. 
            But nevertheless, I found myself seamlessly working with others due to the fact 
            we had similar ideas and similar goals for the project outcome. 

            <br/>
            <br/>
            
            I think group projects are a great way for me to learn how to work with people in the workplace.
            I would reccomend people to look towards group projects with a more positive light given that group work
            could potentially be the future. It could suprise you how much you can get done, when you work together.

            Transitioning to UWI was a rough experience for me as a person who never normally was 
            conditioned to advocate for herself. When it came to highschool and speaking out loud 
            to a large group of people, since I deal with public speaking issue, I avoided public 
            as much as possible. The slight chance I would mess up was too much for me to ever 
            particpate in much social acitivites. But conversly in university, I find myself opening 
            up more. 

            <br/>
            <br/>

            In preparation for the working world I noticed overtime the skill of speaking up for 
            yourself is one of the most important skills you can have. You use it in every aspect of 
            the world in the for example the business, healthcare, educational, political sectors of 
            our society. If there needs to be something done then someone has to speak out in order
            for that action to be noticed by the higher authoritative figure in charge. Not only does 
            it work to avoid misunderstanding but it can help cement a sense of respect from others 
            in the workplace or at school.
